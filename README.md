Requires:

* git
* vim with support for:
  * Python
  * Ruby
  * clipboard
  * X11
* vim pathogen

It's tested on Tmux 1.8 and Vim 7.3 on Ubuntu 12.04 (vim-gnome package).

It also relies on some tmux configuration, that can be found at
<https://github.com/lucabelmondo/dotfiles>.

I tried to avoid overriding built-in and popular setups and keybindings and
to add rather than change functionality.

However it's very likely that this is not really achieved, I'm open to suggestions
on how to make this as unobtrusive as possible.

Thanks for installing! :-)
